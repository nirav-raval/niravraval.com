Well, today I learnt an important lesson. ðŸ¤”  
# The Problem
  
In a recent coding effort, I found myself faced with the classic choice between JavaScript's forEach and for... loops. As I was iterating through an array of data, I realized that my code required asynchronous operations.

**Async/Await in forEach**: Initially, I opted for the simplicity of forEach, but soon hit a roadblock. Despite my attempts to use async/await within the loop, I encountered unexpected behaviour. The asynchronous nature of forEach proved to be a block which led to unhandled promises and unpredictable results. Here's what I was using:

```js
// Using forEach (causes issues with async/await)
dataArray.forEach(async (item) => {
  await processItem(item); // This won't behave as expected
});

```
# The solution

The solution is simple. Use for loop not **foreach** (of course when doing asynchronous operations).

```js
// Using for loop (structured and reliable)
for (const item of dataArray) {
  await processItem(item); // Awaits completion before moving to the next item
}
```

No rocket science right? Now, why did I choose for loop? ðŸŽ¬ the answer is simple, I found relief in its structured approach to asynchronous iteration. With async/await, each loop iteration awaited the completion of asynchronous tasks.
