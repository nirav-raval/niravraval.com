Microsoft [Copilot Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio) is getting better every day! One of the coolest features is the ability to build your own custom agents with knowledge bases, topics, actions, and channels.

In this blog, I‚Äôll show you how to use the [**Send HTTPS Request**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/authoring-http-node) feature effectively. We‚Äôll create a simple agent that fetches random quotes from the [_Breaking Bad_ API](https://breakingbadquotes.xyz/) (I just love using this API to show examples). The API response will return a quote along with the author‚Äôs name (character name) from the series. 

Follow the steps below.

## Step 1: Create a New Agent

Go to [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com) and click on the **New agent** button. For this example, we‚Äôll create the agent **from scratch**, without any use of AI.

Click **Create**.

## Step 2: Add a Topic

You‚Äôre inside your brand-new agent! Let's add a new topic. This is where we‚Äôll place our HTTP request logic.

>Topics are like conversation flows. They define how your agent responds in different scenarios.

Create a **manual topic (From blank)** for this demo.

By default, you‚Äôll see some system generated and custom topics.

## Step 3: Add Trigger Phrases

Now, you‚Äôll see a **trigger** created. This is where you define phrases or description that will start the topic.

Enter the following two phrases:

- Give me a breaking bad quote
    
- New quote

## Step 4: Send an HTTPS Request

Click the **+ icon**, choose **Advanced**, and then select **Send an HTTPS Request**.

![Send Https Request Image 5](/Images/blog_images/2025/May/CS5.png)
We‚Äôre going to call an open-source API to get quotes from _Breaking Bad_.

Enter this URL:
`https://api.breakingbadquotes.xyz/v1/quotes`

Set the **method** to `GET`.

Also:

- Set the **response type** to `any`
    
- Create a variable (I called mine `Quote`) to store the response
    

This API returns a quote and author, we‚Äôll grab and display only **quote**.

## Step 5: Send the Quote to the User

Let‚Äôs show the result to the user. Add a **Send a message** node.

![Send Https Request Image 7](/Images/blog_images/2025/May/CS7.png)
In the message box, use the following `Power Fx` formula to get the quote text:

`First(Topic.Quote).quote`

This pulls the first item from the response and shows the quote.

## Final Step: Name, Save & Test

Give your topic a name like **Get Quote**, then click **Save**. Your topic flow should look something like this:

![Send Https Request Image 9](/Images/blog_images/2025/May/CS9.png)
Now, click **Test**, type **"Give me a breaking bad quote"**, and your agent will fetch a quote from the API and show it!

We just used the **GET** method here, but Copilot Studio also supports **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE**.
