Hello! My name is Nirav Raval, and Iâ€™m a Microsoft 365 Developer at [**2ToLead**](https://www.2ToLead.com). With over 4 years of experience specializing in SharePoint, Iâ€™m passionate about exploring and mastering Microsoft 365 tools and technologies.

My expertise spans **React**, **PowerShell**, **SharePoint Framework**, **Azure**, and **Power Platform**, and Iâ€™m constantly on the lookout for creative, hacky ways to optimize and tweak systems for better performance and usability. I thrive on innovation and love diving into the details of how technologies work.

This space is dedicated to sharing my findings, tips, tricks, and insights, not limited Microsoft ecosystem. Whether youâ€™re looking to learn something new or want to collaborate, youâ€™re in the right place!

Don't Hesitate to send me a [Hi!](mailto:contact@niravraval.com).

Enjoy! ðŸ˜º
