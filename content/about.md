For a long time, Iâ€™ve had the thought of creating a blog to share knowledge and help others. Iâ€™m building this space to discuss the problems I solve. While itâ€™s primarily focused on the Microsoft ecosystem, Iâ€™ll also share tips and tricks that I find helpful across other areas.

Feel free to send me a [Hi!](mailto:contact@niravraval.com).

Enjoy! ðŸ˜º

Nirav
